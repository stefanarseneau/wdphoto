Sloan Digital Sky Survey filters:

He-WD sequences with masses 0.1869, 0.2026, 0.2495, 0.3056, 0.3333,
0.3515, 0.3844, 0.3986, 0.4160 and 0.4481 M_sun. Ages are counted
from the end of mass transfer. Only the evolutionary stages corresponding 
to the final cooling branch is tabulated. For each file, it is listed 
from left to right:

Teff: effective temperature

log g: logarithm_10 of gravity (cm/s**2)

log L/Lo: logarithm_10 of luminosity (in solar units)

Age: age in Gyr
